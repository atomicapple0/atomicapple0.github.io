Hi I'm Brian! I am a 5th year combined B.S. and M.S. student studying [Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). I am part of the [Computer Architecture and Operating System](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~caos/) group and advised by Prof. [Dimitrios Skarlatos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dskarlat/) and [Todd Mowry](https://www.toddcmowry.org/). My main areas of interest are computer systems, machine learning, and gpu programming. Currently I am building LithOS, an operating system for multi-tenant deep learning workloads on GPUs. Previously, I have completed internships at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), and [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us).

Feel free to contact me at `bez (at) cmu (dot) edu`.
